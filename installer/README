Joomla! CLI Installer
=====================

This is a simple script to install extensions from the command-line. This is 
useful for installing extensions when your administrator is hosed because you
just updated a system plugin that has proceeded to wipe out your site (*cough*)
or if you want a mechanism for repeatedly testing your installer packages.

If you are presently using phing, make or ant to automatically build packages
and alternatively might be using those tools to automatically copy files across
then this tool might present a better option for enabling you to repeat install
extensions into a Joomla site.


Usage
=====

Download the "install.php" file and put it in the "cli" directory of your 
Joomla! 2.5 install.

The tool works with either directories or packages:
php cli/install.php ~/Sites/workspace/ban_ip/plugin/

Alternatively if you are running a Linux/Mac system and make install.php
executable then you can do the following:

cli/install.php ~/Sites/workspace/ban_ip/plugin/


It should work with both extension directories and packaged files.
